Remembering what wines you've tried over the course of an evening is hard when you've spent that whole event drinking. Second Glass's tech team and I wrote our first app for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/second-glass/id424968552?mt=8&amp;ls=1">iPhone</a> in Titanium Appcelerator in just three weeks. We are in the process of reworking this app and moving it over to native Objective C. All wines are entered before the event, so even the drunkest person can remember if they preferred that chardonnay. Second Glass's mobile technology is currently being licensed by other Wine Events like Pinot Days and Wines and Wishes.</p>

This time we worked natively, as we had a bit more time to pick up and learn new technology. We've been deliberately maintaining two mobile codebases to preserve the user experience of each.

          <p><strong>About:</strong> Prof. Ben Linder teaches a unique course at Olin that prepares students to make good design decisions for the future of our planet. The course teaches design based on making and understanding sustainable and eco-friendly choices. My team of three studied the environmental impact of desk lamps and then redesigned the product/experience to reduce the impact on the earth. This process included the use of Life Cycle Analysis as well as a broader view of the impacts of the activity of studying at night in college dorms. In our consumer products as with many that we studied in class energy was the largest contributor to the product's impact. Rather than redesigning a lamp specifically we chose to redesign the experience of using energy as a college student. The idea of a dorm dongle product system was the result of this impact research and user experience studies. I entered our <a href="http://www.core77.com/competitions/GreenerGadgets/projects/4328/">Earth $aver Dorm Dongle</a> idea into the Greener Gadgets competition sponsored by Core77 and was named as a "Notable Entry."</p>
